# NOTE: if you use to much main commands like RUN's,
# you could reach the limit of the docker container
# but this only happens when the images is to complex
# so it's better to concatena and reduce main command calls

# NOTE: if you don't modify something that happens
# in a layer, docker will cache the result, reducing the
# execution time

# NOTE: if you only use the FROM command and you already have the 
# image in your local repo, the image will use the image
# and also the image id will be the same, because there's no difference
# to earn space in memory

# NOTE: tags are used to tag images to group them, to identify
# from one to another and so on

# NOTE: install only required stuff, only what run and libraries
# only one program to run by container

# NOTE: slim or alpine versions are better, less heavy is better

# NOTE: container by program is better, unit per unit for scaling

# NOTE: docker history <image> to see layer count

# NOTE: to reduce the image size, try to create less layers
# concatenating commands (specially when get files and you don't need to run)

# NOTE: add checks the file content, to check if they can cached the layer
